# Review journal: summary

Protocol: `.claude/skills/review-continue/SKILL.md`. Launch with "continue reviewing".

`COMPROMISE` mentions after unit 3a: 33 in `src kit tools tests`, 21 in `docs` (count with
`grep -rI COMPROMISE <dirs> | wc -l`). Goal: only real ones keep the label.

Next session: the Queue's top item (the engine law's three inversions): effort `high`, auto mode,
Fable (the drivetrain's engine law), after `/clear`.

The slip floor's two sites ran in `sessions/2026-11-12-slip-floor-sites.md`: a lifted wheel's ABS
floor and TC ceiling read the body's `slip_floor` (`suv-luxury`'s lone grade run unchanged);
`road_change`'s fade keeps `LOW_SPEED_FLOOR` and its comment, doc and test say so.

The shared-law audit ran in `sessions/2026-11-12-shared-law-audit.md`: one tool bug (the descent
ledger's contact velocity on the origin lever) and eight inline copies of a shared predicate,
helper or constant fixed; no site that changes driving, so no proposal; 1 item queued.

Units 1 to 3a were read before the skill asked for simpler implementations: they come back
through the most-commits rule, or sooner on the user's word.

The mechanical sweep ran in `sessions/2026-11-12-sweep-1.md`: one dead test const removed; the
guards (`check_orphans`, `check_docs`) already cover public funcs and citations. Duplicate
tests with different bodies are left to each unit's review.

## Queue (top first)

- The engine law's three inversions (`sessions/2026-11-12-shared-law-audit.md`, finding 9).
  `Drivetrain.fuel_to_land`, `Drivetrain.drag_fuel` and `PedalMap._row_fuel` each compute
  `(net - motoring) / span`; one "fuel for a net crank torque" function serves all three.
  They differ where `span <= 0` (`drag_fuel` gives 0, the others 1 above the motoring law):
  pick one answer, show no shipped curve reaches it, keep the results the same to the bit
  elsewhere (`test_drivetrain`, `test_telemetry`'s idle case). [high, auto]

Deferred until units 3 and 4 are reviewed (it touches both):

- Rigid crank's dead outputs (`sessions/2026-11-11-drivetrain-2a.md`, finding 2). On a body
  where `Drivetrain.drives_wheels` is false, `process`'s returned axle torque reaches no wheel
  and `drive_wheel_omega` is always 0, so the branch's limiter, `crank_forward` and overrun do
  nothing. Remove them, `WheelDrive.tick`'s `axle_torque` path and the tests that pin them;
  keep the free-rev rpm, `applied_throttle` and the gearbox. Also check the branch's
  `esc_cap` line (untested, maybe dead) and reword the one test comment that describes
  `crank_forward` (`sessions/2026-11-12-drivetrain-2b.md` § Deferred). [high, plan]

## Please verify (user, by driving)

- RoadPath's editor buttons after the fold (ebea62a): on a scratch copy of a level, select a
  RoadPath and press "Conform terrain" then "Paint splat under road". Expected: the terrain
  flattens under the road and the road's channel paints, as before, and Ctrl+Z undoes each.
- The semis' part-pedal start gear (dd8dd5e): `semi` or `semi-conventional`, bobtail and with a
  loaded trailer, stopped nose-up on a grade or on soft ground; pull away at a third to half
  pedal. Expected: on some grades it holds one start gear lower than before and pulls away
  without bogging; a floored launch and any launch on flat tarmac are as before.

## Unit map

Sizes are GDScript lines at 716bf06, rounded. A unit's tests and `docs/` pages go with it.
