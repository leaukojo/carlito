# Review journal: summary

Protocol: `.claude/skills/review-continue/SKILL.md`. Launch with "continue reviewing".

`COMPROMISE` mentions after unit 2c: 33 in `src kit tools tests`, 21 in `docs` (count with
`grep -rI COMPROMISE <dirs> | wc -l`). Goal: only real ones keep the label.

Next session: unit 3 (Wheels; 5.1k lines, so split it in the map first and review one part),
effort `high`.

## Queue (top first)

Nothing ready ahead of the map. Deferred until units 3 and 4 are reviewed (it touches both):

- Rigid crank's dead outputs (`sessions/2026-11-11-drivetrain-2a.md`, finding 2). On a body
  where `Drivetrain.drives_wheels` is false, `process`'s returned axle torque reaches no wheel
  and `drive_wheel_omega` is always 0, so the branch's limiter, `crank_forward` and overrun do
  nothing. Remove them, `WheelDrive.tick`'s `axle_torque` path and the tests that pin them;
  keep the free-rev rpm, `applied_throttle` and the gearbox. Also check the branch's
  `esc_cap` line (untested, maybe dead) and reword the one test comment that describes
  `crank_forward` (`sessions/2026-11-12-drivetrain-2b.md` § Deferred). [high]

## Please verify (user, by driving)

- RoadPath's editor buttons after the fold (ebea62a): on a scratch copy of a level, select a
  RoadPath and press "Conform terrain" then "Paint splat under road". Expected: the terrain
  flattens under the road and the road's channel paints, as before, and Ctrl+Z undoes each.
- The semis' part-pedal start gear (dd8dd5e): `semi` or `semi-conventional`, bobtail and with a
  loaded trailer, stopped nose-up on a grade or on soft ground; pull away at a third to half
  pedal. Expected: on some grades it holds one start gear lower than before and pulls away
  without bogging; a floored launch and any launch on flat tarmac are as before.

## Unit map

Sizes are GDScript lines at 716bf06, rounded. A unit's tests and `docs/` pages go with it.

| # | Unit | Paths | Size | Reviewed at | Result |
|---|------|-------|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | COMPROMISE triage | every `COMPROMISE` in `src/`, `kit/`, `tools/`, `tests/`, `docs/` | 72 mentions | c6686e0 | 18 mentions relabelled (design choices, an estimate, an engine limit, a code debt); 54 real ones stay; 1 fix queued |
| 2a | Drivetrain: the class | `src/vehicles/base/drivetrain.gd` | 1.6k | ab672ce | 4 wrong comments on the rigid crank fixed; no dead symbol; both `COMPROMISE` labels real; 1 fix queued (the rigid branch's dead outputs) |
